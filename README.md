# Image-Filtering
Image filtering enhances images by emphasizing features or removing elements, altering pixel values without changing positions. This project transforms a normal picture into a blurred one and applies three filters.

Filter:
1. Sobel Filter: Highlights edges by approximating gradient magnitude.
   
2. Canny Filter: Removes color, leaving gray shades for precise edge detection.

3. Prewitt Filter: Enhances features by approximating the image intensity gradient.

These filters improve image quality by addressing issues like intensity variations, poor contrast, and inconsistentÂ illumination.
